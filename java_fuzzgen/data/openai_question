Hi, I'm looking for your help to write a Java fuzzing harness for the %s Java project.
The project is located in a github repository at %s and I would like you to write a harness targeting this module.
You should use the Java Jazzer framework from Code Intelligence for writing the fuzzer.
The specific function you should target is %s and please use Fuzz as the Java class name.
Also, please use the name fuzzerTestOneInput for the static fuzzing method and use the name fuzzerInitialize for the static method to initialize before fuzzing the target method.
At last, use the name fuzzerTearDown for the static method to tear down the settings after the target method is called.
Could you please show me the source code for this harness and wrap the source code with the <java_code> tag?
