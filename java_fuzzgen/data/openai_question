Hi, I'm looking for your help to write a Java fuzzing harness for the %s Java project.
The project is located in a github repository at %s and I would like you to write a harness targeting this module.
You should use the Java Jazzer framework from Code Intelligence for writing the fuzzer.
The specific function you should target is %s and please use Fuzz as the Java class name.
Could you please show me the source code for this harness?
