Hi, I'm looking for your help to write a Java fuzzing harness for the %s Java project.
The project is located in a github repository at %s and I would like you to write a harness targeting this module.
You should use the Java Jazzer framework from Code Intelligence for writing the fuzzer.
Could you please show me the source code for this harness, wrapped in <code> tag?
