Hi, I'm looking for your help to write a Java fuzzing harness for the %s Java project.
The project is located in a github repository at %s and I would like you to write a harness targeting this module.
Here is a list of requirement:
1) You should use the Java Jazzer framework from Code Intelligence for writing the fuzzer.
2) The specific method you should target is %s.
3) Please use Fuzz as the Java class name.
4) Please use the name public static void fuzzerTestOneInput(FuzzedDataProvider) as the signature for the static fuzzing method.
5) Please use the name fuzzerInitialize for the static method to initialize before fuzzing the target method.
6) Please use the name fuzzerTearDown for the static method to tear down the settings after the target method is called.
7) Please add import statements for necessary classes, except for classes in the java.lang package.
8) Please avoid using the @FuzzTest annotation for specifying the fuzzing method.
9) Please ensure the random fuzzing data is provided by the FuzzedDataProvider class and are initialized before the target method is invoked.
10) Please ensure the methods for getting random data are valid and accessible methods from the FuzzedDataProvider class described in the
    Javadoc API found in https://codeintelligencetesting.github.io/jazzer-docs/jazzer-api/com/code_intelligence/jazzer/api/FuzzedDataProvider.html and
    correct arguments has been given when invoking those methods.
11) If FuzzedDataProvider::consumeString is used, please provides a random integer as argument with FuzzedDataProvider::consumeInt
12) Please ensure the newest version found from the Jazzer's github repository of the FuzzedDataProvider is used.
13) The Jazzer's github repository can be found in https://github.com/CodeIntelligenceTesting/jazzer.
14) Please adds try catch block to catch possible RuntimeException.
15) If the target method is a static method, please avoid create the object before invocation.
16) Please create the necessary objects only if the target method is an instance method.
17) When it is necessary to create an instance of a class, try use the constructors of that class first. If no public accessible constructors are existed, try to search for public accessible
    constructors from any classes that extends or implements that needed class. If no public accessible constructors are found from the target classes or all its subclasses, then try to search
    for static methods in the project that returns an object matching the class of the needed instance and invoke them to get the needed isntance.
Could you please show me the source code for this harness and wrap the source code with the <java_code> tag?
